What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It creates a .git folder with the metadata of the repository. You need to do it to use git function in it.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is where you put your data that you want to add in the next commit. The working directory is the folder
where is located the data that you are working with. The repository is the content of that folder, if the command git init
was already done. It offers a facility to separate commits by logical change.
